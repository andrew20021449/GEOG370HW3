    <h1>Projections - Andrew Bryant</h1>
    <p>Creating different map projections in QGIS is simple! After importing the globe vector and installing the Indicatrix Mapper plugin, all that's needed to create each different map is to change the projection used in the bottom right corner! For this project, I used a lot of common projections, including WGS84 and Pseudo-Mercator, as well as some less common ones, including Adams Square and Azimuthal. I hope you enjoy!</p>
    <p>WGS84</p>
    <p>The WGS 84 projection is an equirectangular projection, which sacrifices area and conformality to preserve distances. Its distortions provide for a visually appealing map, and this it is used for software such as GIS.</p>

    <p>Atioff Projection</p>
    <p>The Atioff projection is an azimuthal projection, but is created by dividing the longitudes and projecting each section before combining the sections. Thus, the projection prserves no specific dimension, in favor of a more visually appealing map.</p>

    <p>WGS84/Pseudo-Marcator</p>
    <p>The Pseudo-Mercator projection is a conformal cylindrical projection that preserves angles at the expense of size. This can be seen in the map through the preservation of the circular shape of the indicatrices but change in shape vertically.</p>

    <p>Sphere Winkel I</p>
    <p>The Sphere Winkel I projection is a pseudo-cylindrical projection that combines equirectangular and sinusoidal projections. The area is scaled to 50Â°28', both North and South.</p>

    <p>World Cylindrical Equal Area</p>
    <p>The World Cylindrical Equal Area projection is a cylindrical projection that has straight latitudes and longitudes. The projection maintains area at the expense of shape and angle.</p>
    <img src="./Indicatrix Maps/Indicatrix 54034.png" alt="">
    <p>World Equidistant Conic</p>
    <p>The World Equidistant Conic projection is a conic projection that preserves distances along the latitudes at the expense of area and shape. The projection is commonly used in east-west countries like the USA.</p>
    <img src="./Indicatrix Maps/Indicatrix 54027.png" alt="">
    <p>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant</p>
    <p>The North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant projection is an azimuthal projection that preserves distance and direction at the expense of shape and area. The projection uses straights longitudes radiating from a center point, in this case the North Pole. It has limited use in representing the Southern Hemisphere due to increasing distortions further from the center point.</p>

    <p>WGS 1984 Adams Square II</p>
    <p>The WGS 1984 Adams Square II is a conformal map projection that heavily bends size and shape to fit into the shape of a square. One can imagine the four corners of the square as being at the equator and poles. The projection serves no practical uses, rather serving as an artistic piece.</p>
    <img src="./Indicatrix Maps/Indicatrix 54098.png" alt="">
    <p>WGS66</p>
    <p>The WGS 1966 Projection is an earlier iteration of the WGS 1984 Projection from earlier. It uses the same projection model, but has slight geographic inaccuracies compared to the 1984 model. WGS84 may one day be updated with an even better model!</p>
